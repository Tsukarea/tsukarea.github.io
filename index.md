# W E L C O M E !

Aspiring game dev, I like to code stuff and mess around in my free time. I mainly use C++ and Python, and have some knowledge of PHP, SQL, Lua and Java as well.

## Current Projects
* Kinoko, a multi-purpose discord bot
* Some simple config files for Awesomewm 
* A small space shooter in c++ with SDL2
